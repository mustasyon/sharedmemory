# Shared Memory Bridge

The Shared Memory Bridge is a Python class that facilitates communication between processes using shared memory. It provides methods for creating shared memory, writing data to it, and listening for data changes.

## Installation

No additional installation is required. The script uses the built-in `mmap` module, which is available in the standard library.

## Usage

To use the Shared Memory Bridge, follow these steps:

1. Import the required modules:
   ```python
   import mmap
   import os
   import signal
   import struct
   import threading
   import pickle
   import time
   ```
````

2. Create an instance of the `SharedMemoryBridge` class:

   ```python
   shared_memory_path = "path/to/shared/memory/file"
   bridge = SharedMemoryBridge(shared_memory_path)
   ```

3. Write data to the shared memory:

   ```python
   data = {"key": "value"}
   bridge.write(data)
   ```

4. Optionally, provide a callback function to be invoked when the shared memory is modified:

   ```python
   def file_changed_callback(data_dict):
       print("Shared memory modified!")
       print(data_dict)

   bridge = SharedMemoryBridge(shared_memory_path, file_changed_callback=file_changed_callback)
   ```

5. Close the shared memory when it is no longer needed:
   ```python
   bridge.close()
   ```
